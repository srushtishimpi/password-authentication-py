# Implementing Password Authentication in Python

---

## Introduction

Password authentication is a fundamental mechanism to verify a user’s identity and restrict access to authorized individuals only. Modern applications require users to enter correct login credentials—usually a username and password—to gain access. This article demonstrates how to implement a password authentication system in Python that **repeatedly requests the username and password until the correct credentials are provided**, enhancing user experience and security.

## What is a Password Authentication System?

A password authentication system acts as a gatekeeper, allowing access only to users who provide valid credentials. For example, when logging into social media or email platforms, you are prompted for a username and password. If these details match stored records, access is granted.

Building such logic is a common coding interview exercise and an essential programming skill. Here, we walk through a Python implementation of a continuous authentication system that repeatedly prompts for credentials until authentication is successful.
